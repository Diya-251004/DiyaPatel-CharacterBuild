Having a genius-level intellect and precise planning skills, The Professor handles the whole operation from backstage by navigating his team to the success with an impeccably planned strategy.</p>

                Rio - The Young Idealist
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Rio, who is in real life Aníbal Cortés, is a young cyber geek and one of the most emotionally charged figures in the series. He came into the picture as Tokyo's love interest, and his youthful idealism is often at variance with the older, more experienced members of the crew.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Rio is among the people who are good at technology and hacking, thus contributing to the heist, but at other times his thoughts that are not realistic come up with reckless decisions. Throughout the development of the series, he struggles with the consequences of their actions, and his feelings toward Tokyo are evident, hence showing how his character dabbles between innocence and maturity.</p>

            <p class="lb_text">Nairobi is deeply committed to her team and, in many instances, acts as the moral guide, ensuring their safety even in the midst of chaos.

                Berlin - The Charismatic Antagonist
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Berlin, whose real name is Andrés de Fonollosa, is the Professor's brother, one of the key players in the heist. Berlin is magnetic and multifaceted, one of which is his talent for being theatrical and often a leader in the group. He is indeed very barbaric and at the same time, a man of integrity, which makes him both endearing and divisive as a character.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">This information on his terminal illness makes his character a more tragic figure, consequently altering his interactions with other characters. Reliving the memories of Berlin's past, which includes his encounters with love and betrayal, is of great significance in the storyline.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Helsinki, whose real name is Mirko Dragic, is a former soldier and the most physically powerful guy in the heist crew. Indeed, it is his characteristic devotion to the group and the protective nature of his character that Helsinki, the muscle, provides both physical security and support in difficult situations.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">His, and Oslo, the other crew member, relationship is one of the heart-touching elements in the series and it is a conduit through which the themes of friendship and sacrifice are shown. Although he is mainly rough and tough, Helsinki sometimes shows his gentle side, especially when it comes to his friends, thus he's a well-chosen character in the team.</p>
